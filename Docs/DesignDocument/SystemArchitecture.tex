\section{Introduction and Overview}
This document provides a description of how PiSonal Trainer will be built. The following are covered in this document:
\begin{itemize}
    %\item An explanation of the templates, symbols and conventions used in the document
    \item Diagram and individual descriptions of the overall component decomposition of the system
    \item Anticipated and unlikely design changes
    \item The Requirements and Design Traceability Matrix relating the system’s components to the project requirements established in the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) document
\end{itemize}

\section{Decomposition into Components}
The system is decomposed based on its different elements in order to allow each component to be implemented and developed independently. Nevertheless, each component interacts with at least one other.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{User Interface (UI)}: The UI encompasses the frontend and backend of the mobile app used to track workouts and display performance history. The app communicates with the database containing a collection of authorized users to authenticate. It also sends exercise performance statistics to the database. A mobile platform is ideal for PiSonal Trainer so that users can easily bring their device to their gyms, and record or view their performance.

\item \textbf{Camera and Counting Algorithm}: Since the camera in use is connected to the device itself, the movement counting algorithm is implemented there as well using OpenCV. This is done to reduce resource overhead that would be generated by sending image information for processing to a remote server. The algorithm is discussed in detail in the Detailed Design document.

\item \textbf{Database}: The database keeps unauthorized users from using the app and stores counts pertaining to a user's exercises. User performance graphs are dynamically generated by querying the database and sending data back to the user's phone. All the counts are stored in the database in order to avoid taking up too much space in the phone's disk.
\end{enumerate}
