\section{Problem statement}

There are many fitness-tracking apps that people use to track their daily fitness routine and
dieting habits. However, the available fitness apps and wearables only go as far as keeping track 
of heartbeat, calories and steps. This may be sufficient for cardiovascular exercises but when it 
comes to muscle training, it is still common for people to use the traditional method of logging 
their progress in a book (i.e., a user might log their workout to keep track of the weights they 
are lifting to evaluate performance).  Using this method requires the person to take note of the 
weight used, the number of repetitions and the sets completed. To date, there is no application 
that automatically calculates and summarizes a userâ€™s personal record for a specific muscle 
training machine, and everyone must make note of their performance after they have completed their 
workout.
