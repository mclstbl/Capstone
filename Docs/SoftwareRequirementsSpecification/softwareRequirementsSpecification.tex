\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\subsubsection{The Background of the Project Effort}
There are many fitness-tracking apps that people use to track their daily fitness routine and dieting habits. However, the available fitness apps and wearables only go as far as keeping track of heartbeat, calories and steps. This may be sufficient for cardiovascular exercises but when it comes to muscle training, it is still common for people to use the traditional method of logging their progress in a book (i.e., a user might log their workout to keep track of the weights they are lifting to evaluate performance). Using this method requires the person to take note of the weight used, the number of repetitions and the sets completed. To date, there is no application that automatically calculates and summarizes a user’s personal record for a specific muscle-training machine, and everyone must make note of their performance after they have completed their workout. 

\subsubsection{Goals of the Project}
We are going to device a tool that integrates and reports a user's performance on a training machine to a smartphone application. We want to enhance the user's training experience by eliminating the need to manually record their performance.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Client}
The prospective clients for this application will be gym owners or managers who would like to incorporate its functionality into their gym to enhance user experience, and to encourage more clients to sign up for their gym.

\subsubsection{The Customer}
The PiSonal trainer is designed for gym members, specifically for users who undergo muscle training using weights. It provides gym members the ability to train using weighted equipment without the need to manually track their performance.

\section{Project Constraints}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}

\textbf{Constraint} \#: 1

\textbf{Description}: The user activate the camera to recognize the weight 

\textbf{Rationale}: The user can select the "log using camera" option in the application to trigger the camera to turn on and detect the weight.

\textbf{Fit Criterion}: Must be approved by tester and developer. They must confirm that the camera gets activated once user selects the "log using camera" option. 

\medskip

\textbf{Constraint} \#: 2

\textbf{Description}: The data from user’s routine must be sent back and stored

\textbf{Rationale}: The end results of the users training session must be stored to the backend database so the user can retrieve it when required

\textbf{Fit Criterion}: Developers and testers must approve the application. Thorough testing will be done on both platforms.

\medskip

\textbf{Constraint} \#: 3

\textbf{Description}: The application must run on iOS or Android operating system

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
N/A

\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
\textbf{OpenCV-Python}
OpenCV-Python is a library used for solving computer vision problems. This library provides a ready-to-use API for image processing algorithms. The PiSonal Trainer camera will leverage this techonology to write specific algorithms to track the motion of the gym equipment.

\textbf{React Native}
React Native is a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. Using this framework requires the developer to only write code once while being able to build the application for both Android and iOS. React Native code is written in Javascript.
The use of this techonology is essential to building the PiSonal Trainer application for the majority of mobile phone users.

%The app will provide a friendly user interface for the gym user to use the PiSonal product from their finger tips.

\subsubsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The users will be using this application in a gym, where it is typically loud and distracting. Hence, the UI of the application will be designed such that there will be minimal need to read in order to understand. Specifically, the UI will have pictures and graphs with less text so that it is simple and straightforward design. This will make the application user-friendly and simple to use.

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
The final deadline for the project is April 5th, 2017. The detailed deliverables and their respective deadlines are listed in the following table.\\

\subsection{The Scope of the Work}
\subsubsection{The Current Situation}
There is currently no existing software that tracks muscle training. A system that integrates with gyms and its members' devices is needed in order to track muscle training workouts as they happen. This system will use a camera that is capable of image processing and detecting a user's performance, and an iOS/Android mobile application that can display statistics from the collected data. The mobile application will include data storage, workout history, and a Quadratic Residue code scanner for gym equipment.

\section{Project Issues}
\subsection{Open Issues}
Our implementation consists of creating an entirely new product for fitness training applications. There have previously been no significant efforts to implement this functionality, wherein image recognition is utilised to automatically record a user's performance. There are also no open issues outside of implementing this product.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
N/A

\subsection{New Problems}
Our contribution is completely new; there are no products currently in the market that implement the same functionality. Hence, there are no new problems to consider. 

\subsection{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Propose design solution to the project supervisor
    \item Implement the solution and provide the source code to the project supervisor for review
    \item Update design to incorporate suggestions and merge changes to main PiSonal trainer repository once tasks have been successfully completed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
N/A

\subsection{Risks}
As this is a new product, there are no risks that can impact the project in terms of old code. All the tests will be based on the new requirements and desired  product functionality.

\subsection{Costs}
There are no costs involved in the implementation of PiSonal trainer. All the technology to be used is open source; hence there are no expenses incurred.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
User documentation will accompany a brief explanation concerning how PiSonal trainer works and how users can use it to enhance their training experience. PiSonal trainer requires minimal input from the user. However each input will be explained through a step-by-step tutorial to help setup the application. The User Documentation will include several visuals to help the user comprehend what the application's interface should look like from beginning to end. 

\subsection{Waiting Room}
Our project consists of implementing a new application. There are no other features that have been out of scope for this project as our requirements have been scoped to satisfy the main needs for the initial release.
