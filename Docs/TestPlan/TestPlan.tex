\subsection{Automated Testing}
 Automated testing will be used for testing the applicationâ€™s system, specifically the backend processing of data and transmitting it to the mobile application. The automated testing will encompass both unit testing and coverage analysis. The test cases have been created such that unit testing can be performed on independent components of the application, allowing testing to run alongside the development of the application.
 
\subsubsection{Testing Tools}
The software tools that will be used to perform the automated testing are listed in the following table.

\begingroup
\begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{5cm} | p{5cm} |} 
    \hline
    \textbf{Tool} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Use}\\

    \hline
    Nose & Python test coverage analyzer & Analysis of unit test coverage\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{List of Testing tools}
\endgroup

\subsection{Manual Testing} 
Manual tests will be conducted throughout the development of the application. It will be used for testing the application where automation testing is not feasible or efficient. The developers will carry out these tests as part of their development process. 

\subsubsection{User Experience Testing} 
Manual testing will also be used to assess the overall user experience of the application. The user experience testing will be conducted by allowing a group of individuals who were not involved in the development of the application to complete end-to-end testing of the application. The testers will be given a copy of the application and will be asked to provide feedback. The same individuals will be asked to complete the test twice; once in mid-February and once in mid-March. This will allow us to implement the feedback provided in February and re-test to see if the changes meet users' expectations.

% PROOF OF CONCEPT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Proof of Concept Testing}
Proof of Concept testing is to be carried out before the developing the rest of the project. In this section, the project's significant risks, demonstration plan and proof of concept test plan will be discussed.

\subsection{Significant Risks}
The successful completion of the project depends on overcoming the following significant risks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The products's exercise counting mechanism must be reliable before it is completed. It needs to be able to accurately count exercise repetitions.
    
    \item The product needs to give quick feedback showing the user's performance statistics on their phone once a they finish a set. Designing an effective database schema would reduce the processing time between storing user data and showing it to the user. It would also significantly lower the chance of errors and make them easier to detect while inserting data in using an inefficient database schema.
    
    \item The camera plays a huge role in the success of the project because it is used to detect the motion of the user. Low resolution images, large image distance from the camera, and undetectable markers pose a significant risk to the quality of motion detection generated.
    
    \item The user's privacy of information is also an important factor in implementing this project since losing trust may cause failure. Finding ways to protect users' data is a significant risk.
    
    \item Availability of the product is also required for the completion of this project. Thus, having an uptime service of 99.9\% is essential. Such expectations present a significant risk if the server goes down due overload or a bugs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Demonstration Plan}
For proof of concept we will be implementing a simple algorithm as a prototype to track the movement of a dumbbell in a hand. As the hand moves up and down the program will count the repetition of bicep curls. We will be using the camera of our laptops to demonstrate this plan. The scope of this plan is limited to demonstrating that the significant risks can be overcome. 

As a user does bicep curls in front of the laptop our prototype will count repetitions of the exercise. This will show that the algorithm accurately counts the repetitions. This prototype will also give a good understanding of the minimum resolution of an image that is required for the final product to actually detect objects. Moreover, it will provide us an estimate of how far away objects can be from the camera to be detectable.

The prototype will also include a backend server conencted to a database with a well-designed schema. The backend server will be extensively load-tested by hitting it with mock requests to demonstrate that it can handle stress and overloads due to computation and multiple requests.

\subsection{ Proof of Concept Test}
The proof of concept is given in test case format to adhere with the presentation of the other tests in this document.

% SYSTEM TESTING
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{System Testing}
Each component of the project will be tested using black-box techniques through automated unit testing and manual user input. Test coverage tools will also be utilised to identify portions of code that lack unit tests. After each component is tested, they will be verified as one integrated system. The individual components to be tested are object detection, counting algorithms, database and backend server operations, and the mobile application interface; the specific test cases are defined in this section.

\subsection{Object Detection}
