\section{Introduction}
This report illustrates the results of both the system tests and requirements tests on PiSonal Trainer. The system tests for the functional requirements are reported based on each individual module of the application. The non-functional tests include tests for user experience.

\section{Automated Tests}
Automated tests have been used in this project to unit test various parts of the system, and to gather data for coverage analysis. The application’s components fall into two main parts: the front end react-native mobile application, and the back end transmission of data to and from the mobile application. 

The client side react-native components were tested using Jest, a JavaScript unit-testing framework.  Unit tests were written for each module of the application to ensure that every method functions as intended, and that all exceptions are handled.

The server side data processing and transmitting was tested using the using PostMan. PostMan is a tool for testing APIs, which can be used to test operations by setting endpoints and the expected server responses. We use PostMan because it provides features that  enhance the testing experience, such as calculating a response's total round trip time, and enabling overloading to test the server's performance. Through this server side testing we can detect broken links and endpoints.

Moreover, we have been executing these tests on a daily basis and also between every pull request submission. This ensures that new code changes do not break the system.


\section{Manual Tests}
We manually tested the system ourselves. All the group members used the PiSonal Trainer app on a daily basis, in order to ensure that the application is executing to its potential.

Whenever a new exercise or movement was added to those that the app can detect, we extensively tested that it could be detected during typical (i.e., in a gym or with real weights) usage of the app.

Moreover, we added analytics collection that run in the background in order for us to see the overall endurance of the system. Since the app will be used by users, they will play the role of manual testers by sending back usage data.

\section{System Tests}
In this section the test cases conducted on each module is illustrated. The test cases are mapped to the requirements. [Note: our current requirements have changed from our previous document and will be updated].

\subsection{User Experience Test}
The user experience test for PiSonal Trainer was evaluated by surveying test participants their opinion on the functionality of the application. The results from the survey are displayed in table User Experience Survey Results.

\subsubsection{User Experience Survey Discussion}
Examining the survey results, we came to understand the common trends of users experience. Overall the users appreciated the camera’s functionality to track and update their workout. Only one person from our test population had a concern with the camera, out of 8 people. Also, the average time spent to handle the application, as a new user was approximately 9 minutes. From the provided feedback, this number decreased over time as they continue to use the application. Hence, the results are positive and meets our current expectations. 

\section{Summary of Changes}
In the future, the manual tests can be improved by having non-members of the group perform tasks and report back their observations. This would improve our testing by revealing whether the app is intuitive to use, and if it works as expected even if the user is not aware of how the backend software functions. Moreover, the user interface can be improved by getting feedback from more testers, and refining the flow of the application based on the results. With these changes, we hope to make using PiSonal Trainer easy and intuitive for others.
