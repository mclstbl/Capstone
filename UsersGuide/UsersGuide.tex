\section{Introduction}
PiSonal Trainer is a mobile application designed to monitor a user's fitness goals by recording and reporting their performance on a given exercise. It aims to reduce problems caused by taking training performance notes at the gym by instead using the phone camera to detect the user's movements. Collected repetition and weight data are reported back to application and is synced to a database, which is visible on any device in which the user is signed in. Registered users can create a profile, access their workout logs, view their performance statistics, and manage their meals consumed on a daily basis.

\section{Troubleshooting}
\subsection{Overview}
PiSonal Trainer aims to ensure that users do not encounter bugs while using the app. To prevent bugs in the app, it was tested using Travis after adding each new functionality. This section will go over some common problems or bugs a user might find while using the PiSonal Trainer app.

\subsection{Internet connection}
PiSonal Trainer requires an internet connection to sync the workouts' repetition counts with the servers. If the app fails to connect to the internet, check your internet connection or connect to a different network.

\subsection{Visual Glitches}
A user may encounter visual glitches while using the app, this may be due to the incompability of an operating system or the screen resolution. In case of a visual glitch, refer to the System Requirements defined in Section 5 of this manual, and verify that they are satisfied.

\subsection{Data Loading Slow}
While using the app, it will be making many requests to the server to retrieve data (for example: workout statistics). If the loading is slow, check your internet connection or connect to a different network.

\subsection{Motion Detection}
PiSonal Trainer detects motion using the camera so if it does not detect the workout movements of the user or if the motion detection is breaking while they are working out, check the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item There needs to be ample lighting for the camera to detect the objects in its view, and to distinguish between colours.
    \item Make sure that there are no background colours similar to that of the weight that may interfere with motion detection
    \item If neither 1 nor 2 work, then you are welcome to report this as a bug within the app.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Frequently Asked Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Do I need to make an account to use PiSonal Trainer?} \\
    Yes. PiSonal Trainer loads and stores fitness tracking data in real-time so it needs to be associated with a user account in order to be accurate. You will need a user name, password and email in order to sign up.
    
    \item \textbf{I forgot my password. What do I do?} \\
    In case you forget your password, click the "Forgot my password" link in the Login page and you will be directed to reset it after receiving a password change email.
    
    \item \textbf{How do I change my password?} \\
    To change your password, log in to the PiSonal Trainer and go to the Settings tab. A password change option is there; it will have a form in which you need to enter your old and new passwords.
    
    \item \textbf{Are images and/or videos of me stored anywhere?} \\
    No. PiSonal Trainer's camera input functionality analyzes your movement in real-time and only takes note of the number of repetitions and sets for each exercise. It does not need to store nor transmit any captured images.
    
    \item \textbf{Can I use the app on multiple devices?} \\
    Yes - as long as you sign in using the same user account on all of them. Since PiSonal Trainer syncs user data in real-time, any device in which a user signs on will show the same data.
    
    \item \textbf{Is PiSonal Trainer free?} \\
    Yes!
